    "Description": "I have updated my Visual Studio and Silverlight tools until today. When I create a silverlight application using silverlight 4 and add the CoverFlow control\nto the page it throws the error :Error HRESULT E_FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component.\nI tried using Silverlight 3, and it does not throw any errors at all. I have also tried adding the System.Windows.Controls.Data.Input to the project reference\nand import to the page with control xmlns:my=\"clr-namespace:System.Windows.Controls;assembly=System.Windows.Controls.Data.Input\" .\nÂ \nEven after doing that it still throws the same error. Can you please suggest me what I should be doing ?",
