      "Message": "I believe i know what the problem is here.  when new items are added or removed they are correctly added to the items list, but the layout is not properly updated.  I fixed this issue (partially) in the copy i dowloaded by adding an override to the OnItemsChanged method:\r\n\r\n  protected override void OnItemsChanged(System.Collections.Specialized.NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            base.OnItemsChanged(e);\r\n            if (SelectedIndex > items.Count) SelectedIndex = items.Count - 1;\r\n            LayoutChildren();\r\n        }\r\n\r\nAlso there is the occasional issue (im not sure why where there is a CoverFlowItemControl in the items array which has not been templated yet.  this causes some issues so i also added a simple check to CoverFlowItemControl.SetValues:\r\n\r\npublic void SetValues(double x, int zIndex, double r, double z, double s, Duration d, IEasingFunction ease, bool useAnimation)\r\n        {\r\n            if (!HasAppliedTemplate) return;\r\n...\r\n\r\nThis seems to be working for me, I hope it works for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
