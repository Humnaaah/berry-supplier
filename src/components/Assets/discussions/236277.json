Setting the control's ItemsSource to null and then back to the reordered observablecollection doesn't work (exception).</p>\r\n<p>This is probably one of those 'be prepared to slap yourself of the forehead' -things but I can't figure this out by myself.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks already in advance for any ideas.</p>\r\n",
