    "Html": "<p>I believe apple has changed how well they stream movies from their servers.&nbsp; They look at the useragent and if it ins't something &quot;iTunes/8.2.1 (Windows; N)&quot;, or in otherwords coming from their application, then it doesn't perform very well.&nbsp; Sometimes it takes a while to even start playing and then the download is very slow.&nbsp; So they must be throttling their servers if it is not coming from their application.&nbsp; Unfortunately silverlight doesn't allow modification of the useragent.&nbsp; So it is because of apple that it isn't performing very well.&nbsp; However, I'm not sure why it would be giving you a network error.&nbsp; I know some movies had some problems.&nbsp; The best thing to try is set some break points when it tries playing the file and see what the url it is trying to play is and then try opening the url up in a web browser or something and see what it gives you.</p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps,</p>\r\n<p>Darick<span style=\"color:#a31515;font-size:x-small\"></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
