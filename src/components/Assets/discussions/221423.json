Quite easy to use, I have been able to do verything I wanted so far, yet there is still one thing that troubles me :</p>\r\n<p>After displaying all my items, I would like to be able to change the image used for some of these items (a delayed loading I have to implement due to a complex data structure behind it all). I can change the image without any problem in CoverFlowControl.ItemsSource items but these change have no effect graphically.</p>\r\n<p>I tried calling&nbsp;.UpdateLayout(); on this component to force a refresh but to no avail.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any idea on how I could implement my partial delayed loading ?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Jonathan</p>",
